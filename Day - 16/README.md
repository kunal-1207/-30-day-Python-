# Prometheus Alert Fetcher

A Python script to fetch and display top active alerts from a Prometheus server using its API.

## üì¶ Features

* Connect to a Prometheus server and verify its health status.
* Fetch all active alerts (state: 'firing').
* Display alerts in a structured format with name, severity, state, and summary.
* Provides troubleshooting tips in case of connection failure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Prometheus server running and accessible
* Internet connection (for fetching alerts)

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

* requests

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Update the configuration values in the script:

* `PROMETHEUS_URL`: URL of the Prometheus server (e.g., `http://localhost:9090`).
* `TIMEOUT`: Connection timeout in seconds.
* `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`: Uncomment and update if authentication is required.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python alert_fetcher.py
```

## üê≥ Running Prometheus in Docker

You can run Prometheus locally using Docker with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus
```

Access the Prometheus web UI at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

## üìù Code Breakdown

### Configuration

```python
PROMETHEUS_URL = "http://localhost:9090"  # Change to your Prometheus server
ALERTS_ENDPOINT = "/api/v1/alerts"
TIMEOUT = 5  # seconds
```

* `PROMETHEUS_URL`: Base URL for the Prometheus server.
* `ALERTS_ENDPOINT`: API endpoint for alerts.
* `TIMEOUT`: Request timeout duration.

### Authentication

```python
# USERNAME = "your_username"
# PASSWORD = "your_password"
```

* Uncomment and set these values if your Prometheus instance requires authentication.

### Testing the Connection

```python
def test_prometheus_connection():
    health_url = f"{PROMETHEUS_URL}/-/healthy"
```

* Checks the health status of the Prometheus server using the `/-/healthy` endpoint.

### Fetching Active Alerts

```python
def get_active_alerts():
    url = f"{PROMETHEUS_URL}{ALERTS_ENDPOINT}"
```

* Connects to the `/api/v1/alerts` endpoint to fetch active alerts.
* Filters alerts that are in the `firing` state.

### Displaying Alerts

```python
def display_alerts(alerts):
```

* Formats and prints alert details including name, severity, state, and active duration.

### Main Function

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

* Entry point for executing the script.

## ‚úÖ Troubleshooting

* Verify Prometheus server URL.
* Check network/firewall settings.
* Update authentication credentials if required.
* Increase the timeout value if necessary.
